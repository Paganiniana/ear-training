# Ear Training

Travis CI, Jest Tests: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Paganiniana/ear-training.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Paganiniana/ear-training)

## Description

This project is an Angular/Ionic project, intended for use as an iOS/Android/PWA app.  We use Jest for testing and Travis CI for automated testing and deployment.  It is an application that combines visual-learning and SRS in a way that is helpful for music students or enthusiasts of any level.  The only reason it is here is to be used.  The code is open source so that ambitious music teachers and school-based music departments can implement it themselves, if they wish.

## Usage

The license is 100% open, feel free to do with this source code what you will.  We have left it open to encourage ambitious coders, teachers, and IT departments to craft something uniquely helpful for their students.  If you have any questions about how to deploy it for your use-case, feel free to contact us.
